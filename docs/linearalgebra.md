# Linear algebra
This library implements an extensive set of algorithms for linear algebra operations.
We implement two basic data structures called `NVector` and `NMatrix` that models the mathematical objects vector and matrix respectively.
The underline data type for the elements of the vectors and matrices is `double`.

## Vector operations
The supported mathemaical operations in vector are:
* Vector sum
